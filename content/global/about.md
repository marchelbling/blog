I call myself a software engineer. I defended a Ph.D thesis entitled [Virtual sculpture using particles system](http://www.theses.fr/2010ISAM0030) and Iâ€™ve been an early stage engineer in [some](http://tinyclues.com) [successful](http://captaintrain.com) [startups](http://sketchfab.com) in Paris, France.
