My name is Marc Helbling. I’m a software engineer with a Ph.D thesis (“[Virtual sculpture using particles system](http://www.theses.fr/2010ISAM0030)”). I’ve been an early stage engineer in [some](http://tinyclues.com) [successful](http://captaintrain.com) [startups](http://sketchfab.com). I am now building smart products at [Algolia](https://algolia.com).

I am mostly interested in building efficient teams and systems, with a special ❤️   when they deal with vertices and polygons.
