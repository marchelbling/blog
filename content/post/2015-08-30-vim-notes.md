All this is vim built-in and requires no plugin.

* `%`: jump to the matching `{ .. }` or `( .. )` etc.
* `=`: indent visual selection (`<`: shift block to the left, `>`: shift block to the right)
* `~`: change case
* `ctrl-x` + : [vim ‘context aware’ complete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TX3kV3TICU) mode (based on `set complete` list) in insert mode
    * `ctrl-n`/`ctrl-p`: next/previous word matching prefix (the difference with `ctrl-p`/`ctrl-n` is the context awareness)
    * `ctrl-f`: file names
    * `ctrl-l`: whole lines
    * `ctrl-d`: macro definitions (also in included files)
    * `ctrl-i`: current and included files
    * `ctrl-k`: words from a dictionary
    * `ctrl-t`: words from a thesaurus
    * `ctrl-]`: tags
    * `ctrl-v`: Vim command line
    * `ctrl-o`: language aware completion
* `:set spell [spelllang=fr_fr]`/`:set nospell`: activate/deactivate spell checking
* `:!<command>`: execute `<command>` in a shell without leaving vim (e.g. `:!make`)
* `:read !<command>`: insert result of `<command>` on next line (e.g. `read !ls .`)
* `ctrl-O`, `ctrl-I`: navigate through “[jump locations](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Jumping_to_previously_visited_locations)” locations, both within current and other opened documents; `:jumps` to list all jump locations.
* `.`: repeat last command
* macro recording:
    1. `q<key>`: start recording
    2. (do commands)
    3. `q`: stop recording
    4. `@<key>`: replay macro
* command mode (ex/ed):
    * general syntax: `:[[start_line],[end_line]]<verb>/<pattern>/<action>`
        * lines shortcuts:
            * `:%` ⇔  `:1,$`: all the lines
            * `.`: current line
            * `$`: last line
        * verbs:
            * `g`: match line with pattern
            * `v`: reverse match lines
            * `s`: substitute
        * action:
            * `d`: delete
            * `y`: yank
            * `<position>j`: join (`-1j` go up one line and join)
            * `m<position>`: move lines (e.g. `m$` to move at the end of file)
    * examples:
        * `:%g/foo/s/bar/zzz/g`: for every line containing `foo` substitute all `bar` with `zzz`.
        * `:%g/bar/m/baz/+1`: moves next `bar` occurrence 1 line after next `baz` occurrence
        * ``:%g/bar(/ normal nmaf(ldi(`aPa.``:
            1. `g/bar(/`  executes the following command on every line that contains "bar("
            1. `normal`   execute the following text as if it was typed in in normal mode
            1. `n`        goes to the next match of "bar(" (since the `:g` command leaves the cursor position at the start of the line)
            1. `ma`       saves the cursor position in mark a
            1. `f(`       moves forward to the next opening bracket
            1. `l`        moves right one character, so the cursor is now inside the brackets
            1. `di(`      delete all the text inside the brackets
            1. `` `a``     go back to the position saved as mark a (i.e. the first character of "bar")
            1. `P`        paste the deleted text before the current cursor position
            1. `a.`       go into insert mode and add a "."
        * `vim convert.csv "+:v/^\"oai:/-1j" "+wq"` : [concatenate lines](http://superuser.com/a/565566/218469) starting by `"oai:` with previous line using a [non-interactive script](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/14226)
